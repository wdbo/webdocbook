Special files in *WebDocBook*
==========================

Any file named `INDEX.md` in a directory will be considered as its index and be delivered if 
no other file is requested in the URL.

Any file named `README.md` in a directory will be displayed at the bottom of the directory 
contents indexing, just like the default behavior of Apache.
